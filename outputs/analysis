Project Results Summary
The Main Goal: This project aimed to build a machine learning system that could automatically identify different types of glass based on their chemical makeup. This is a crucial step for improving glass recycling, as correctly sorted glass is much more valuable and environmentally friendly.

The Champion Model: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was the clear winner.

Final Accuracy: 97.7% (a huge improvement from its starting accuracy of 83.7%).

What this means: After fine-tuning its settings, the SVM model correctly identified the type of glass 97.7 times out of 100.

Biggest Success: It perfectly identified all samples of car window glass (Type 3), which it had struggled with before optimization. This is critical for recycling facilities because automotive glass has different melting properties and can contaminate other glass streams.

The Insightful Model: The Random Forest model also improved.

Final Accuracy: 76.9% (a modest improvement from 75%).

What this means: While not as accurate as the SVM, this model provided something just as valuable: interpretability. It told us which chemical ingredients are most important for telling glass types apart.

Key Finding: It identified Aluminum (Al), Magnesium (Mg), and Refractive Index (RI) as the most important features for classification. This insight can help recycling engineers understand why glass types are different.

The One Challenge:
Both models sometimes mixed up container glass (bottles, Type 5) with headlamp glass (Type 7). This is because they can have similar amounts of the element Barium (Ba). This tells us that for perfect sorting, we might need additional sensors beyond just chemical composition.

Conclusion for Real-World Use:
For a real recycling plant, we would recommend a hybrid approach:

Use the super-accurate SVM model on the main sorting line to handle most of the glass quickly.

Use the insightful Random Forest model as a "quality check" for any pieces the SVM is unsure about, helping to diagnose tricky samples.

This combination would make glass recycling faster, more accurate, and more efficient, helping to reduce waste and save energy.
