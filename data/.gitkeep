## Description
The dataset contains 214 glass samples with 10 attributes:
- **1 ID number**
- **9 predictive features:** Refractive index (RI) and oxide compositions (Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) measured as weight percent.
- **1 target variable:** Glass type (7 classes).

## Glass Types (Target Variable)
1. Building Windows (Float Process)
2. Building Windows (Non-Float Process)
3. Vehicle Windows (Float Process)
4. Vehicle Windows (Non-Float Process) *[No instances in this dataset]*
5. Containers
6. Tableware
7. Headlamps

This data is used to train and compare SVM and Random Forest models for automated glass recycling classification.
